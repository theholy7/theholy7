### Hi there, my name is Jose! 👋

I am an Engineer that produces code.

I care about good code, good design, good testing, and good monitoring. Things that make software easier to work with, and easier to maintain and run.

**🔭 I’m currently working at:** [Cable](https://cable.tech)! _(we are hiring!)_

I actually joined Cable because of our CEO's blog post about the values of the company. You can read that [here](https://natashavernier.medium.com/turning-values-into-an-operating-system-2d960b4f10fc). I felt that these values would lead me to an incredible company, and that ended up being true! 🎉

Cable is on a mission to reduce financial crime in the world.

It sounds as cool as it is! We are writting software to help compliance officers, new fintechs, and partner banks work better. With our tool, they can focus on what really matters as we monitor all their data.

In the team I belong to (the great Data Engineering team 👨🏻‍🔬👷🏽‍♀️) we are building the data pipeline that powers our product. We use a mixture of technologies:

* Airflow _via Google Cloud Composer_
  * We use the `KubernetesOperator` and `Docker`
* Python for all our coding
  * All your classics: _Pandas, Pytest, etc._
* A sprinkle of Bash scripting
